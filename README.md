# VATRIX - Visual Algorithm Space

An interactive React + TypeScript + Vite learning space with three live subjects, each a five-unit course: **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** (`/algorithms`), **Data Structures** (`/data-structures`) and **Linear Algebra** (`/linear-algebra`). Every topic has a visualizer, syllabus-referenced theory notes and auto-graded practice, in Explore, Student and Teacher modes.

## Run locally

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite (normally `http://localhost:5173`). To make a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
npm test        # runs the domain tests for all three subjects
```

## Database (Supabase)

Without a database, each browser keeps its own progress in localStorage. Connect Supabase and every student's answers, time on task and the teacher's assignments are stored in one shared Postgres database, so the Teacher dashboard sees the whole class on any device — and updates live.

### 1. Create the project

1. Sign up at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and click **New project**.
2. Pick a name (e.g. `vatrix`), set a database password (store it in a password manager — the website never needs it) and choose the region closest to your students. Wait about a minute for it to start.

### 2. Create the tables

1. In the project, open **SQL Editor → New query**.
2. Paste the whole of [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) and click **Run**. You should see "Success. No rows returned".
3. Check **Table Editor**: `students`, `attempts`, `activity` and `assignments` should be listed, each marked as RLS enabled.

### 3. Connect the website locally

1. In Supabase open **Project Settings → API** (or the **Connect** button) and copy the **Project URL** and the **publishable / anon key**.
2. In the project folder copy the template and fill in the two values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. Restart `npm run dev`. In the lab sidebar the status line changes from "Saved in this browser" to **"Saved to the cloud"**.
4. Open Student mode, sign in with a name and answer a problem. The row appears in **Table Editor → attempts**. Anything this browser had saved before is uploaded automatically on first connect.

`.env.local` is git-ignored. Never commit it, and never use the **secret / service_role** key in the website: it bypasses all security rules.

### 4. Connect the deployed site (Vercel)

1. In Vercel open the project → **Settings → Environment Variables**.
2. Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with the same values (for Production and Preview).
3. Redeploy (**Deployments → ⋯ → Redeploy**). Vite bakes these values in at build time, so a redeploy is required after any change.

### 5. Turn on student and teacher accounts

With Supabase connected, practising (Student mode) and the Teacher dashboard need an account; the visualizers stay open to everyone. Accounts use email + password (Supabase Auth).

1. **Run the latest schema.** If you ran an older `schema.sql`, run the current one again (SQL Editor → paste → Run). It adds the `profiles` and `teacher_emails` tables and replaces the old open rules with account-based ones.
2. **Set the site address.** In Supabase open **Authentication → URL Configuration**:
   - **Site URL**: your live site, e.g. `https://your-site.vercel.app`
   - **Redirect URLs**: add `https://your-site.vercel.app/signin` and `http://localhost:5173/signin`

   Confirmation and password-reset emails link back to these.
3. **Choose email confirmation.** In **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email**, "Confirm email" is on by default: new users must click a link before signing in. Leave it on for real use; turn it off while testing. Supabase's built-in mailer sends only a few emails per hour — for a whole class, add your own SMTP under **Authentication → Emails → SMTP Settings**.
4. **Make yourself a teacher.** Every new account is a student. To make someone a teacher, add their email (lower-case) in **Table Editor → teacher_emails → Insert row**, or in the SQL Editor:

   ```sql
   insert into public.teacher_emails (email) values ('you@example.com');
   ```

   This works before or after they sign up; their role changes at once (they may need to sign in again). Delete the row to turn a teacher back into a student.
5. Open `/signin` on the site, create your account and sign in. The lab sidebar shows your name, your role and a Sign out button.

### How it works

- `src/lib/auth.tsx` handles sign-in, sign-up, password reset and sign-out, and loads each user's profile (name and role). `src/pages/SignInPage.tsx` is the `/signin` page.
- A database trigger creates the profile when someone signs up and gives them the teacher role if their email is in `teacher_emails`. Nobody can change their own role from the website.
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` reads and writes the tables; `src/domain/sync.ts` works out exactly which rows changed (unit-tested in `sync.test.ts`).
- `useDB` in `src/domain/tracking.ts` keeps a private browser cache per account (cleared on sign-out), writes every change there at once and sends it to Supabase in the background. If Supabase can't be reached, the status line says "Offline" and the data is uploaded on the next visit.
- Supabase Realtime pushes changes from other devices, so an open Teacher dashboard refreshes by itself.

### Security

The database rules (Row Level Security in `schema.sql`) are what protect the data, not the website:

- Signed-out visitors can read and write nothing.
- A **student** can read and add only their own answers and activity, and can't see other students.
- A **teacher** can read every student's progress, create assignments, and add or remove the demo class.
- Nobody can edit or delete real answers from the website, and roles can only be changed in the Supabase dashboard.
- The publishable (anon) key in the website is meant to be public; never put the secret / service_role key in the site.

Data recorded before accounts existed (students identified only by a typed name) stays in the database and is visible to teachers, but can't be claimed by a student account. Without Supabase configured, the site falls back to the old name-only mode with data kept in the browser.

### Adding a subject

1. Add its units and topic summaries in `src/domain/<subject>/units.ts` and problems in `src/domain/<subject>/problems.ts` (include them in `src/domain/problems.ts`).
2. Build its visualizers in `src/components/<subject>/` and map topic ids to them in `src/courses/<subject>.tsx`.
3. Add a page in `src/pages/`, a route in `src/main.tsx`, and set `path` on the subject in `src/domain/subjects.ts`.

## Coverage — Design & Analysis of Algorithms

- **Unit I — Algorithm analysis (fully visual):**
  - _RAM model:_ line-by-line tracer for three programs (Θ(1), Θ(n), Θ(n²)) with per-line cost, run counts, memory/registers, a running cost meter, a T(n) chart and a "when n doubles" ratio panel.
  - _Asymptotic notation:_ growth-rate race (1, log n, n, n log n, n², 2ⁿ) on linear or log scale; a bound prover that computes the exact smallest n₀ for O, Ω and Θ from your own f(n), g(n), c₁ and c₂.

## Coverage — Data Structures

Follows the syllabus unit by unit (29 topics, 58 practice problems). Topics shared with the Algorithms course reuse its visualizers.

- **Unit I — Introduction & arrays:** data organisation (field, record, file, keys), operation costs per structure on a log scale, a time–space trade-off calculator; address calculation for 1-, 2- and 3-D arrays in row- and column-major order with the memory layout drawn; traversal, insertion and deletion with every shift animated; linear vs binary search side by side; sparse matrices as triplets with simple transpose, fast transpose (rowTerms / startingPos) and sparse multiplication.
- **Unit II — Recursion & linked lists:** the call stack for n! and the Fibonacci recursion tree with repeated calls highlighted; N-Queens backtracking with pruning and undo; singly, doubly and circular lists (insert at head, tail or position, delete, search, reverse) with CUR/PREV pointers and the new node drawn; generalized lists with tags, depth and length; polynomial addition and multiplication on term lists.

## Coverage — Linear Algebra

Follows the syllabus unit by unit (27 topics, 54 practice problems). Most visuals are a coordinate plane with vectors you drag, or a rotatable 3-D view of ℝ³; matrices can be typed in or loaded from presets.

- **Unit I — Modern algebra & vector spaces:** ℤₙ operation tables with the group axioms checked live, zero divisors and when ℤₙ is a field; a subspace tester (drag u, v and c to find counterexamples); a gallery of vector spaces — ℝ³ in a rotatable 3-D view (spans as lines and planes, linear combinations, cross product, volume test), the matrix space M₂ₓ₂ (matrices as coloured tiles with coordinates in ℝ⁴ and its symmetric/diagonal/trace-zero subspaces), polynomial spaces Pₙ (curves and coefficient vectors, a Taylor basis, d/dx as a matrix) and complex spaces ℂ and ℂ² (complex scalars rotating vectors, the Hermitian inner product); span drawn as a lattice of combinations, with an ℝ³ dependence test; a basis grid that reads off coordinates; direct sums that split a vector along two lines.
- **Unit II — Linear transformations:** the plane morphing from I to any 2 × 2 matrix with linearity checked on your vectors; step-by-step row reduction with range and null-space bases and rank + nullity = n; orthogonal and oblique projections (P² = P); Gauss–Jordan inversion of [A | I]; change of basis P⁻¹AP (diagonal in an eigenbasis); dual bases drawn as families of level lines.
- **Unit III — Eigen-theory:** determinant as area scale and orientation, trace, transpose and cofactor expansion; a vector sweeping the circle to find eigenvectors; Cayley–Hamilton summed term by term with the minimal polynomial; diagonalization with the eigenbasis grid and Aᵏx; Jordan blocks from rank(A − λI)ᵏ; unit balls of the 1-, 2- and ∞-norms and their images.
- **Unit IV — Inner product spaces:** dot and weighted inner products with Cauchy–Schwarz and the triangle inequality; Gram–Schmidt in the plane (stepped) and in ℝ³ (table); least squares as an orthogonal projection with draggable data points; adjoints and Hermitian / unitary / normal tests for complex matrices.
- **Unit V — Bilinear & quadratic forms:** B(u, v) = uᵀMv with its symmetric and skew parts and congruence PᵀMP; quadratic forms as heat maps with principal axes, eigenvalues, leading minors and signature.

## Modes

- **Explore:** interactive visualizers, input controls, intermediate states and concept notes. While a student is signed in, time spent and steps taken per topic are recorded automatically.
- **Student (manual practice):** sign in with a student account (or, without Supabase, just enter a name), see your mastery per topic, practice auto-graded problems (60 for Algorithms, 58 for Data Structures, 54 for Linear Algebra, at least two per topic), use hints, and open the matching visualizer. Teacher assignments appear here.
- **Teacher (automated, teacher accounts only):** no grading or data entry. The dashboard derives class accuracy, weakest topics, most common misconceptions, students needing attention, a student × topic heatmap, per-student drill-down (time, steps, misconceptions), and one-click auto-assignment of the weakest topics. Export CSV/JSON.

## How tracking works

- `src/domain/problems.ts`: problem bank. Each wrong answer maps to a named misconception.
- `src/domain/tracking.ts`: data model, localStorage persistence (`useDB`), analytics, and `useActivityTracker`.
- Mastery = share of the last 6 attempts answered correctly (a correct answer after a hint counts half), shown only after 2+ attempts. Below 50% = struggling, below 75% = developing.
- `src/domain/daa/**`, `src/domain/ds/*.ts` and `src/domain/la/*.ts`: pure, deterministic logic behind every visual (seeded, no randomness); the `*.test.ts` files verify it against textbook results.
- Data Structures topic ids start with `ds-` and Linear Algebra ones with `la-`, so progress in different subjects never collides; one student profile covers all three.
- `src/domain/demo.ts`: "Load demo class" in Teacher mode creates 8 synthetic students (flagged demo, removable).
- A student tab and a teacher tab in the same browser stay in sync through the `storage` event.

## Current limits

- Without Supabase configured, data lives only in the browser's `localStorage` and there are no accounts. With it, there is still one class: every teacher sees every student (no separate classes or rosters yet).
- Student identity is a typed name, not authentication.
- Auto-grading covers multiple-choice and numeric problems only. The old keyword-based writing checklist is no longer used.
- Visualizer step counts are tracked for the sorting and BFS/DFS steppers and all Unit 1 steppers; other visualizers record time only.
- Some panels are still concept demonstrators (tree panel, Boyer–Moore, shortest-path rounds use fixed illustrative values).

## Next milestones

1. Classes: rosters and class codes, so each teacher sees only their own students.
2. More problems per topic (or parameterized generators) so mastery is not based on repeats of one question.
3. "Predict the next step" interactions inside the visualizers, logged as attempts.
4. Real implementations for the tree, Boyer–Moore and shortest-path panels; unit tests; accessibility checks.
